            <p>“My fulfillment of the American Dream looks like the ability to pursue things that I am interested in and I care about because other basic needs have been covered. I don’t have to worry about mere survival which is what can happen when social order collapses." </p>

            <p> Corey likened his definition of the American Dream to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four freedoms - specifically freedom from want and fear. Some of Corey’s closest ancestors have experienced more recent fear of being persected as ethnic minorities in their home countries, which has resulted in a unique appreciation for the American Dream model.  
             </p>

            <p>
                Corey is especially grateful for the life he leads in America. The American Dream has allowed him to lead a life in which he can pursue his goals and dreams - something his ancestors didn't have the luxury of before settling in America. However, he regognizes this is not yet true for everyone in America and until it is, the American Dream will not be truly recognized.
