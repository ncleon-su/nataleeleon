          <div class="biography"> 
           
            <p> Corey’s paternal great great grandparents were both Jewish individuals living in Romania. As Eastern Europe became an increasingly dangerous place for Jewish people to live, they fled to Ottoman Palestine. After a few years, they migrated to Mansfield, Connecticut to begin a new life free from fear. Years later, Corey’s father was born, and is now a doctor. </p>

            <p>Corey’s maternal grandfather was born in Norway, and migrated to Boston to study at Boston University. His maternal grandmother is of Armenian descent. She was born in Beirut, Lebanon after her parents fled from Marash, Turkey during the Armenian genocide. Corey’s grandmother migrated through Cyprus to study nursing at Boston University, where she met her husband. Corey’s mother was born, and became a doctor.</p>
